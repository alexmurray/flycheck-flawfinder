;;; Commentary:

;; This packages integrates flawfinder with flycheck to automatically check for
;; possible security weaknesses within your C/C++ code on the fly.

;;;; Setup

;; (with-eval-after-load 'flycheck
;;   (require 'flycheck-flawfinder)
;;   (flycheck-flawfinder-setup)
;;   ;; chain after cppcheck since this is the last checker in the upstream
;;   ;; configuration
;;   (flycheck-add-next-checker 'c/c++-cppcheck '(warning . flawfinder)))

;; If you do not use cppcheck then chain after clang / gcc / other C checker
;; that you use

;; (flycheck-add-next-checker 'c/c++-clang '(warning . flawfinder))

;;; Code:
(require 'flycheck)

(flycheck-def-args-var flycheck-flawfinder-args flawfinder)

(flycheck-def-option-var flycheck-flawfinder-minlevel 1 flawfinder
  "Set the minlevel to use for flawfinder."
  :type '(integer :tag "minlevel")
  :safe #'integerp)

(flycheck-define-checker flawfinder
  "A checker using flawfinder.
